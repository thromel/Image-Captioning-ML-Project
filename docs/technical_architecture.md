# Image Captioning - Technical Architecture Documentation

## Project Overview

This document provides a detailed technical description of the "Image Captioning using Show, Attend and Tell" project, which implements a neural network model for generating descriptive captions for images based on the paper "Show, Attend and Tell" by Kelvin Xu et al.

## Architecture Overview

The project implements an attention-based encoder-decoder architecture for image captioning, consisting of:

1. **Encoder**: A CNN-based feature extractor that processes input images
2. **Attention Mechanism**: Allows the model to focus on different parts of the image while generating each word
3. **Decoder**: An LSTM-based sequence generator that produces the caption text word by word

## System Requirements

- **Python**: 3.7
- **Primary Dependencies**:
  - PyTorch 1.9.0
  - torchvision 0.10.0
  - NumPy 1.19.5
  - NLTK 3.6.3
  - PIL/Pillow 8.3.2
  - pycocotools
  - pytorch-pretrained-bert

## Dataset

The model is trained on the MS-COCO (Microsoft Common Objects in Context) dataset:
- Contains over 330,000 images with 5 captions each (~1.6 million captions)
- Training/validation split handled via the data_loader.py module
- Data is preprocessed and tokenized before training

## Detailed Component Architecture

### Encoder (models/encoder.py)

```
Encoder
├── ResNet-101 (pretrained)
└── Adaptive Average Pooling
```

- Uses a pretrained ResNet-101 model with the classification layer removed
- Processes input images to extract feature maps (2048 feature channels)
- Applies adaptive average pooling to resize feature maps to 14×14
- Returns feature maps with dimensions (batch_size, 14, 14, 2048)

### Decoder (models/decoder.py)

```
Decoder
├── Embedding Layer (BERT or standard embedding)
├── Attention Mechanism
│   ├── Encoder Attention Linear Layer
│   ├── Decoder Attention Linear Layer
│   └── Attention Linear Layer with Softmax
├── LSTM Cell
└── Output Linear Layer
```

- **Embedding Options**:
  - Standard word embeddings (512 dimensions)
  - BERT embeddings (768 dimensions) - pretrained contextual embeddings
- **Attention Mechanism**: Calculates attention weights over encoder feature maps
- **LSTM Cell**: Processes the concatenated embeddings and attention-weighted features
- **Output Layer**: Projects hidden state to vocabulary size for word prediction

### Data Loader (data_loader.py)

- **Training/Validation Loader**: Handles MS-COCO dataset for training/validation
- **Demo Loader**: Handles loading single or multiple images for inference
- **Transformations**: Image preprocessing with cropping, normalization, and tensor conversion

### Training Process (train.py)

```
Training Pipeline
├── Initialize Encoder and Decoder
├── Load Vocabulary
├── For each epoch:
│   ├── For each batch:
│   │   ├── Process images through Encoder
│   │   ├── Process captions through Decoder
│   │   ├── Calculate Loss (Cross-entropy + Attention Regularization)
│   │   └── Update model parameters
│   └── Save checkpoint
└── Final model saving
```

- Training parameters:
  - Gradient clipping: 5.0
  - Batch size: 16
  - Learning rate (decoder): 0.0004
  - Number of epochs: 4
  - Optimizer: Adam

### Validation Process (validate.py)

- Evaluates model performance on validation set
- Calculates BLEU scores (1, 2, 3, 4) for generated captions
- Can visualize attention weights over input images

### Loss Function (models/loss.py)

- Cross-entropy loss for caption prediction
- Attention regularization term to ensure the model attends to the entire image

## Data Flow

1. **Image Input**:
   - Image is loaded and preprocessed (resized, normalized)
   - Passed through the encoder to extract visual features

2. **Caption Generation**:
   - Decoder generates words sequentially
   - At each timestep, attention mechanism determines relevant image regions
   - LSTM cell updates its state based on previous word, context vector, and hidden state
   - Output layer predicts the next word
   - Process repeats until END token is generated or maximum length is reached

## Inference Process

```
Inference Pipeline
├── Load input image
├── Process through Encoder to get feature maps
├── Generate caption sequentially:
│   ├── Initialize with START token
│   ├── For each step until END token:
│   │   ├── Calculate attention weights
│   │   ├── Generate context vector
│   │   ├── Update LSTM state
│   │   └── Predict next word
└── Return complete caption
```

## Special Features

1. **BERT Integration**: Option to use BERT embeddings for enhanced semantic understanding
2. **Attention Visualization**: Capability to visualize which parts of the image the model focuses on while generating each word
3. **Checkpoint System**: Ability to resume training from checkpoints

## Evaluation Metrics

- **BLEU Scores**: Standard machine translation metric (BLEU-1, BLEU-2, BLEU-3, BLEU-4)
- **Validation Loss**: Cross-entropy loss and attention regularization term

## Configuration and Hyperparameters

Key hyperparameters in the model:
- **Encoder**: 
  - Feature dimension: 2048 (from ResNet-101)
  - Feature map size: 14×14
- **Decoder**:
  - Embedding dimension: 512 (standard) or 768 (BERT)

## Training Workflow

1. Initialize encoder and decoder models
2. Load vocabulary from processed data
3. Iterate through training epochs:
   - Process batches of images and captions
   - Calculate loss (cross-entropy + attention regularization)
   - Update model parameters
   - Checkpoint model periodically (every 1000 batches)
   - Learning rate decay (multiplied by 0.8 every 1000 batches)
4. Save final model

## Inference Workflow

1. Load trained encoder and decoder models
2. Process input image through encoder
3. Generate caption word by word:
   - Start with START token
   - At each step, calculate attention weights and context vector
   - Predict next word until END token or maximum length
4. Return complete caption

## Performance Considerations

- GPU acceleration recommended for training
- BERT embeddings provide better semantic understanding but increase computational requirements
- Attention mechanism adds computational overhead but significantly improves caption quality
- Batch size may need adjustment based on available GPU memory

## Extension Possibilities

1. **Ensemble Models**: Combine multiple models for improved performance
2. **Alternative Architectures**: Replace LSTM with Transformer architecture
3. **Fine-tuning**: Additional fine-tuning on domain-specific datasets
4. **Beam Search**: Implement beam search for inference to improve caption quality
5. **Integration**: Expose model as a service via REST API
